# Pop-It-
A game inspired by Pop The Lock, but with motion controls!

This project was created by Mawb Mentality—a fictional game studio founded by Anirudh Kumar, Vishal Canumalla, and Kevin Xu—for the IB Computer Science End of Year project.
The game was programmed using C# and the Unity game engine.

To play, download the Android APK to your smartphone.

The game is played as follows:
* Tilt your phone to collect the yellow dots
* Remain on the dot for half a second to score a point
* You have thirty seconds to collect as many dots as you can
* Upon successful collection of a dot, you may be rewarded with bonus time. The chance of bonus time decreases as you get more dots
* Keep playing to beat your high score!

Thanks for playing! We hope you enjoyed i!
